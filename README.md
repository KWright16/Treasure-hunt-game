# City Quest API

This api serves up end points for both the react-native app and react administration web page for City Quest; a location based multiplayer treasure hunt style game featuring question and photo recognition challenges. The administration webpage also allows users to log in and create their own games.

## Key Funtionality
The API makes calls to a Firestore database which contains all the information on games, routes and challenges. The API also makes calls to the 3rd party google API to utilise their photo recognition and journey planning services.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Alternatively the hosted version is available at the bottom of the page.

### Prerequisites

You will need a google cloud vision API key and a firestore database. Once you have set up the firestore database, in the firebase console, go to settings and then service accounts. You can then copy the databaseURL from the snippet into the config file below. Just below the url snippet will be a generate new private key button, this will download a json file. Copy this into the projects main directory and rename as treasure-hunt.json. 

You will also need to install the prerequisites for running and testing the application by running the following on the command line.

```
$ npm install
```

Your config file will need to be in the following format:

```
const config =
    process.env.NODE_ENV === "test"
        ? "if using insert test database here"
        : "insert databaseURL here";

const cloudVisionAPIkey = "insertGoogleKeyHere";

module.exports = { config, cloudVisionAPIkey };

```

To do this create a file called config.js in the main directory and copy in the above code, inserting in your keys where neccessary.

Finally the database can be seeded by typing the following in the console:
```
node seed/seedDev
```
